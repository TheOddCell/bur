# Contributing/Adding your own packages
Each package directory may only contain 10kB.

Any other files at that point must be downloaded from the internet from an open source hoster, like github, gitlab, or your own git server.

### Scripts
Exactly what they say on the tin. You must use busybox `sh` from `/bedrock/libexec/busybox sh`.

Any and all config files must be placed in `/usr/config/[package name]/`, and be generated by the script on first use.
### Fetch scripts
See https://bedrocklinux.org/0.7/extending.html#brl-fetch-new-distros
### Binaries
[architecture] must match the output of uname -m, e.g. x86_64, aarch64, etc that your binary may be compiled for.

Binaries must not be included directly in the repository. Use links to downloadable resources (e.g., GitHub Releases).

Each binary must be staticly linked and be self contained.

Any and all config files must be placed in `/usr/config/[package name]/`, and be generated by the binary on first use.
### `info.bur`
Here's an example from `fetch/idlebox`:

(both fetch scripts and normal scripts use the same format and comments don't actually work in `pmmm` as of this moment)
```
version=2.0.0
description=Simple stratum with just busybox and a few config files
files=idlebox
# ^ Any files that will be installed. May include URLs or normal files, seperated by spaces.
# | If this is a script or binary, it will be placed in /bin or the helper's desired location.
# | If this is a fetch script, it will be placed in /bedrock/share/brl-fetch/distros/.
url=https://github.com/TheOddCell/idlebox/
# ^ Homepage URL
maintainer=TheOddCell
# ^ Seperated by spaces, GitHub usernames of anyone who is allowed to edit this, including the person who made it
readmepls=please read the setup instructions at https://github.com/TheOddCell/idlebox/blob/main/README.md
# ^ Important info, such as "Please read the readme!".
licence=The Unlicence
# ^ Licence that your code uses.
```
Any files not listed in `files` will be uncopied, but still usable depending on the helper.

For `pmmm`, it will be placed in `[pmmm strata]/usr/bur/[type]/[name]`

If you do not want to fill in the field, it must be set to `"/dev/null"` but not gone.
I am not joking. This is with the exception of `readmepls`, where it can be empty. It must still be there, just with nothing after the `=` sign.
